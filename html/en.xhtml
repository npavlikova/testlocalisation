<h1>Jabberwocky</h1>
   
<p>Twas brillig, and the slithy toves</p>
   
<p>Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:</p>
   
<p>All mimsy were the borogoves,</p>
   
<p>And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>
   
<p>Beware the Jabberwock, my son! </p>
   
<p>The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! </p>
   
<p>Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun </p>
   
<p>The frumious Bandersnatch!</p>  
   
<p>He took his vorpal sword in hand: </p>
   
<p>Long time the manxome foe he sought -- </p>
   
<p>So rested he by the Tumtum tree, </p>
   
<p>And stood a while in thought. </p>
   
<p>And, as in uffish thought he stood, </p>
   
<p>The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame, </p>
   
<p>Came whiffling through the tulgey wood, </p>
   
<p>And burbled as it came! </p>
   
<p>One two! One two! And through and through </p>
   
<p>The vorpal blade went snicker-snack! </p>
   
<p>He left it dead, and with its head </p>
   
<p>He went galumphing back. </p>
   
<p>And hast thou slain the Jabberwock? </p>
   
<p>Come to my arms, my beamish boy! </p>
   
<p>Oh frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!</p>
   
<p>He chortled in his joy. </p>
   
<p>Twas brillig, and the slithy toves</p>
   
<p>Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:</p>
   
<p>All mimsy were the borogoves,</p>
   
<p>And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>
